# Documentation

Documentation is a necessary part of the plugin user experience. While we seek to make our products as intuitive and understandable as possible within the interface of the plugin itself, users will occasionally still need longer, more detailed explanations.

Writing and contributing to our online documentation is an important and vital role of all Support Technicians. This section describes exactly how we collaborate as a Team to develop docs, and contribute to our online documentation.
