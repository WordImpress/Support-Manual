# Documentation Responsibilities for All Support Technicians

Contributing to our online documentation is the responsibility of all of our Support Technicians. To that end, we have implemented the following practices to ensure our docs get appropriate attention and are reviewed and updated rigorously. 

## Daily Check-ins

Every day in the `#documentation` Slack channel, there is a reminder to post your Docs status update. When that reminder comes in, you should be able to report on three things:

1. What I worked on yesterday \(or the previous work day\).
1. What I am working on today.
1. Any blockers keeping me from doing that work today.

## Using The Feedback Site for Docs Feedback

Throughout your daily interactions with customers and users, you'll be referring to our docs and you might also get feedback about our docs. Part of your contribution to our online documentation is to provide those insights and feedback to our Docs team.

We provide that feedback via the [feedback site](https://feedback.givewp.com). 

Part of your daily tasks can be reviewing existing feedback, voting on posts, commenting on them with additional insights, linking to new Help Scout threads that give more user feedback, and -- of course -- creating new feedback. 

### Creating Docs Feedback Posts

#### Document Name
Docs feedback titles should either be able to complete the sentence "I'd like to learn about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the docs" or follow the Bug Report pattern of `{x} should ...` where `{x}` is the current doc or doc section that is incorrect.

#### Category
There are two categories of docs feedback:

**Web Documentation** - Use this category when user-facing functionality needs web documentation outside the product on our website.
**Contextual Documentation** - Use this category when user-facing functionality needs contextual documentation inside the product

##### Some examples of contextual documentation:
All contextual documentation in this screenshot is highlighted in red:

Field descriptions and tooltips are among the most common types of contextual documentation.
The link in the bottom right corner is an example of contextual documentation that leads to further web documentation.

#### Details
Use the Details box to give as much context as needed for what is currently missing or incorrect in the documentation. Remember that this is public, so keep the initial details as generic as possible, and add further details as an internal comment. 

#### Comments
Once the feedback post has been created, use internal comments to add as much detail as possible, so that the docs Project Manager has enough information to create the doc task in Asana. Additionally, add as a comment \(with a link\) any feedback recieved in other channels \(Priority Support, Facebook, etc\) or customer/user insight that helps to explain the need for the documentation.

#### Voters
On documentation feedback, adding voters is not necessary unless a customer specifically requested the documentation. If so, add them as a voter.

These posts are processed by the Docs Project Manager and Head of Support to create the Asana tasks for the entire Support Team to implement.

**Important**  
Keep in mind that the feedback site has a public-facing side. When you post new feedback, don't reveal anything about users or customers at all. If you need to reference a user or customer in a comment, you can set that as an internal comment only. Even then, it's best simply to avoid posting any sensitive information into the feedback site at all.

## Navigating Asana

We track our docs tasks in Asana. The "board" view is best to track what docs are "To Do", "In Progress", "For Review", "Approved/Ready to Publish", or "Complete".

Each technician is expected to manage their tasks and move them to the appropriate column as they progress on their docs. 

The Docs Project Manager and Head of Support are responsible for the "For Review" and "Approved/Ready to Publish" and "Complete" columns. 

At the end of each week, the Doc Project Manager will post a Progress Report detailing what got done each week. Each technician should review that report to be informed of the team's collective work and heed any advice or directives for the next week's Docs work.
