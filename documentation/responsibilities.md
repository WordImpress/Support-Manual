# Documentation Responsibilities for All Support Technicians

Contributing to our online documentation is the responsibility of all of our Support Technicians. To that end, we have implemented the following practices to ensure our docs get appropriate attention and are reviewed and updated rigorously. 

## Daily Check-ins

Every day in the `#documentation` Slack channel, there is a reminder to post your Docs status update. When that reminder comes in, you should be able to report on three things:

1. What I worked on yesterday \(or the previous work day\).
1. What I am working on today.
1. Any blockers keeping me from doing that work today.

## Navigating Asana

We track our docs tasks in Asana. The "board" view is best to track what docs are "To Do", "In Progress", "For Review", "Approved/Ready to Publish", or "Complete".

Each technician is expected to manage their tasks and move them to the appropriate column as they progress on their docs. 

The Docs Project Manager and Head of Support are responsible for the "For Review" and "Approved/Ready to Publish" and "Complete" columns. 

At the end of each week, the Doc Project Manager will post a Progress Report detailing what got done each week. Each technician should review that report to be informed of the team's collective work and heed any advice or directives for the next week's Docs work.

## Using The Feedback Site for Docs Feedback

Throughout your daily interactions with customers and users, you'll be referring to our docs and you might also get feedback about our docs. Part of your contribution to our online documentation is to provide those insights and feedback to our Docs team.

We provide that feedback via the [feedback site](https://feedback.givewp.com). 

Part of your daily tasks can be reviewing existing feedback, voting on posts, commenting on them with additional insights, linking to new Help Scout threads that give more user feedback, and -- of course -- creating new feedback. 

These posts are processed by the Docs Project Manager and Head of Support to create the Asana tasks for the entire Support Team to implement.

**Important**  
Keep in mind that the feedback site has a public-facing side. When you post new feedback, don't reveal anything about users or customers at all. If you need to reference a user or customer in a comment, you can set that as an internal comment only. Even then, it's best simply to avoid posting any sensitive information into the feedback site at all.
