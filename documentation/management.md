# Managing Tasks for Docs

Online Documentation is a never-ending and vast project that is ever-changing. The only way to ensure that work on docs is done in an efficient manner with no overlap between technicians is to manage the tasks in a transparent and central place.

Properly managing our online docs requires the following:

* Project Management Tool
* Reporting on your Tasks
* Coordinating with the Development Team

## Project Management Tool

We use Asana for managing docs tasks. One team member \(under the supervision of the Head of Support\) leads in project managing docs, to keep the rest of the team aware of what needs to happen in docs.

### Creating Docs Tasks

Every significant change or update to our docs starts by creating a new Asana task. 

There is a template in the Asana board that technicians use to create the issue. Provide enough detail in the task so that no matter who is assigned to it they can understand exactly what the desired outcome of the task is. Use subtasks to create a checklist so that the technician will know that they have completed the task.

### Assigning Tasks

Once a task is created in Asana, it is placed in the "To Do" column of the board. From there, the docs project manager assigns the issue to a team member, which alerts that team member. Once the team member begins work on a task, they move it to "In Progress" to indicate to the team that they are working on it. 

Each team member in docs should have one task in "In Progress" at all times, and should use their daily standup in the #documentation Slack channel to report on progress of their assigned in progress task\(s\).

### Prioritizing tasks

Not all docs tasks are created equal. Some tasks are urgent, while others might be an ongoing goal.

The docs project manager \(with the help of Support Leadership and Development\) is responsible for prioritizing docs tasks so that critical errors and omissions are resolved. 

Prioritization becomes more acutely important in advance of and immediately following major releases of the product. During these times, tasks are tagged to indicate being a part of the release, and those tasks should be prioritized. This is done by the docs project manager during the QA portion of the development team's release cycle.

## Reporting on Your Tasks

Lead by the docs project manager, there are daily standup meetings \(conducted asyncronously in Slack in the #documentation channel\) where three things are reported:

1. What I worked on yesterday \(or the previous work day\).
1. What I am working on today.
1. Any blockers keeping me from doing that work today.

## Coordinating with the Development Team

The product managers on the development team, along with the developers themselves, are in charge of making sure that enhancements and changes to the product that require modification of the online docs are tagged in a specific way within the GitHub repositories. 

It's the role of the docs project manager to regularly consolidate issues from GitHub into tasks in Asana, and to tag those tasks in conjunction with a release, when applicable.

Keep in mind that the documentation writing experience itself can sometimes be instructive in highlighting user issues that might need to be improved upon before release.
