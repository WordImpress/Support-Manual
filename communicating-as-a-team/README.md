# Communicating as a Team

Because we are \(almost\) never in the same room to communicate, and are distributed across time zones and continents, team communication is a critical piece of how our team functions.

Depending on the subject matter or the need for synchronous vs. asynchronous coomincation, we use different tools.

Generally, for real-time communication and [team meetings](weekly-meetings.md) we use Slack calls and Google hangouts. For asynchronous communication, we use [Slack](using-slack.md) and if the issue warrants tracking to completion or needs the input of the development team we use [GitHub](../daily-routine/contributing-to-github-issues.md).

Email is generally reserved for HR-related requests and reimbursements.
