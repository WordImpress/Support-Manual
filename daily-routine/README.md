# Daily Routine

As a distributed team, we highly value clear expectations and communication regarding what we are doing.

Clear communication keeps the whole team informed of activity and gives Support Leadership a simple way to know what's happening at any given time.

Here's a general overview of what is expected throughout the day. Any significant deviation from this should be discussed with the team.

* Login to Slack and announce that we’re starting our day \(using `@here` is useful so Slack only pings those who are currently online\)
* Start the day with a 30-40 minute [Mental Energy Kickoff](mental-energy-kickoff.md) -- report in the appropriate slack channel what we accomplished.
* [Unassigned/Assigned](unassigned-vs-assigned.md) -- always communicate in \#support whenever we are switching between Docs, or Unassigned, or Assigned
  * If it’s before 5:00 AM Pacific, check on Unassigned, If it’s out of control, get it in control. Otherwise, get as much Assigned done as we can until 5:00 AM Pacific.
  * At 5:00 AM Pacific, work on Unassigned.
  * Throughout the rest of our Priority Support time, prioritize [first response](../principles-of-providing-excellent-support/providing-effective-first-response.md) times, and resolving Assigned tickets.
* Breaks -- Announce our breaks and when we’ll be back. Eat, walk, or do something that gives us a MENTAL/PHYSICAL break away from the computer. Break length is not as important as communicating when we'll be back, and making sure we are working enough hours total each day. 
* Throughout our day, do our [\#QueueHealthHabits](queue-health-habits.md). This is particularly important to do before we move into "Decompress Time".
* 30 Minutes before the end of our day, do something productive outside of Priority Support as [Decompress Time](decompress-time.md).
