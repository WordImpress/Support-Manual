# Creating and Contributing to Github Issues

As a part of our role of customer ambassador, when we find a problem, bug, or area for improvement in the plugin or an add-on, we escalate it to the product team in the form of an issue on GitHub. This is done during ticket time, as a part of the flow.

Any time we create an issue on GitHub, we notate the ticket with the GitHub URL and the GitHub issue with the Help Scout URL.

The following are all valid reasons to create an issue:

## Bugs

If in the course of replicating customer issues we find a bug that is replicable in a separate environment, we should immediately create an issue on GitHub in the appropriate repository. Keep in mind that issues created in public repositories are visible by anyone, and should use discretion when it comes to discussing internal policy or issues.

In creating the issue, we take care to ensure that the developer tasked with replicating the problem has all necessary information to quickly replicate the problem, and find a solution. It is the job of the support technician to help the developer anticipate how fixing the bug could impact other use-cases of the plugin or add-on. We know \(often with more clarity than the development team\) how our users are using the plugins, and should give them as much context as possible.

## Feature requests

When a customer requests a new feature, we listen. As support technicians, it is not our job to weigh the validity or feasibility of a feature request, so much as to keep a record of how many customers are asking for certain features. For the purposes of creating issues for feature requests, all of those should be routed through the senior support technicians or the head of support, for simplicity.

## Clarification based on user insight

We highly value customer insight into issues of user interface, interacting with other plugins, themes, or the greater WordPress ecosystem, etc. An example of an issue to escalate to the product team would be clarifying the language of an in-app documentation string based on user feedback.
