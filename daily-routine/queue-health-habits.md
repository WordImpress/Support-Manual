# \#QueueHealthHabits

A healthy queue is one with the following characteristics:

1. No ticket is still pending or active after the issue is resolved.
2. No active ticket is left for more than 1 business day without a response.
3. No pending ticket is "left hanging" waiting on a response to an issue.
4. No ticket is untagged.

Because all of the above scenarios are difficult to maintain at scale, it's imperative that support technicians block out time to tend to the three aspects of \#QHH.

That's done in the following ways:

* Reviewing and Closing Pending Tickets
* Ensuring all tickets with bug feedback are tagged waiting-on-fix
* Reviewing and Adding Tags

## Reviewing and Closing Pending Tickets

Since our first response is designed to be thorough, many times it will resolve the problem, and the customer simply does not reply back. At least twice per week, weâ€™ll reply to those tickets with the `Close` saved reply, which encourages a response from the customer, and then if they do not reply by the next day, we close the ticket.

## Ensuring all tickets with bug feedback are tagged waiting-on-fix

Tickets that have identified issues and bugs are tagged as `waiting-on-fix` in Help Scout, and left as pending. Feature requests are not tagged `waiting-on-fix`, and are closed with a link to the feedback. During QHH time, we ensure that the tags are correct for those two scenarios. When feedback is marked as complete \(for bug fixes or features\), we circle back with all associated customers linked from the feedback. That procedure is outlined in the appropriate section of the [Product feedback article](contributing-product-feedback.md#delivering-development-team-feedback-to-customers).

## Review/Add Tags

Navigate to tickets marked closed as well as your assigned tickets, and tag them where necessary. No ticket should be untagged. Tags help with reporting, scaling the support team, and giving support leadership as well as product team members a high-level view of what is going on.
