# \#QueueHealthHabits

A healthy queue is one with the following characteristics:

1. No ticket is still pending or active after the issue is resolved.
2. No active ticket is left for more than 1 business day without a response.
3. No pending ticket is "left hanging" waiting on a response to an issue.
4. No ticket is untagged.

Because all of the above scenarios are difficult to maintain at scale, it's imperative that support technicians block out time to tend to the three aspects of \#QHH.

That's done in the following ways:

* Reviewing and Closing Pending Tickets
* Reviewing and Handling waiting-on-fix
* Reviewing and Adding Tags

## Reviewing and Closing Pending Tickets

Since our first response is designed to be thorough, many times it will resolve the problem, and the customer simply does not reply back. At least twice per week, we’ll reply to those tickets with a “Close Ticket due to inactivity” canned response, which encourages a response from the customer, and then if they do not reply by the next day, we close the ticket.

Also, during that time, ensure that any cc'd emails were correctly added to the original reply, and if not, reply with an apology for not cc’ing correctly.

## Reviewing and Handling waiting-on-fix

Tickets that have identified issues and bugs are tagged as waiting-on-fix in Help Scout, and left as pending. During \#QHH time, review the associated Feedback on [the GiveWP Feedback Site](https://feedback.givewp.com) \(or add the feedback link to the top of the ticket in a note\) and respond accordingly. 

Note that issues on GitHub are created once the team is actively working on them in the current development cycle. 

Depending on the issue status, here's how to respond:

### Issue has been created is resolved

Reply to the customer with either the version of the add-on or GiveWP core that the issue is fixed in, and close the ticket. Leave the waiting-on-fix tag for historical reference.

### Issue has been created and is not resolved, but actively being worked on

It is meaningful for our customers to hear back that “we’ve not forgotten about this issue, and the dev team is currently working on it.”

Be careful not to over-promise on a release timeline.

### Issue is has not been created
If we check and discover an issue has not been created, we ping the Head of Support or the Senior Support technician to interface with the development team, at their discretion.

If you’ve responded more than once with “I just checked and the dev team is not currently working on this issue” or similar, use discretion “poking the bear” here. Understand and empathize that an issue which is not what the dev team deems “critical” is still critical to a customer \(especially if their boss, board, or donors are asking about it\).

This is also a great time to add an internal comment linking to the Help Scout ticket, if the user is reaching out repeatedly. Conversations in Slack's \#Support channel are encouraged before replying to a user.

## Review/Add Tags

Navigate to tickets marked closed as well as your assigned tickets, and tag them where necessary. No ticket should be untagged. Tags help with reporting, scaling the support team, and giving support leadership as well as product team members a high-level view of what is going on.
