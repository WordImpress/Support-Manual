# Decompress Time

One of the realities of ticket-based support is that ticket time will expand to fill the space given to it. There will always be more tickets.

As support technicians, we are more than "professional emailers" who answer tickets all day.

We make that fact tangible by spending the last 15-30 minutes of our day "decompressing" so that we leave the day with something other than tickets on the brain.

This time is spent doing testing, documentation, writing blog content, or any other work-related non-ticket activity. It often works well to use the same activity or tangentially similar activity to [mental energy kickoff time](mental-energy-kickoff.md) during decompress time.

As a part of signing off for the day, we share in the \#support channel on Slack what we did for decompress time.
