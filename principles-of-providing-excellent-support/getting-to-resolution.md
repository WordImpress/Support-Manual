# Getting to Resolution

Beyond the first response, every interaction with a customer in support has a singular goal: we get to resolution.

We solve our customer’s problems, in 3 replies or fewer. A resolved ticket is one that has at least one reply from the customer after the initial contact, and has been marked closed by us. We don’t mark a ticket as closed until it is confirmed resolved, or the customer has not replied after a few days and after we have followed up asking for confirmation.

The first response is always marked as Pending, waiting for the customer to confirm the fix. We encourage a response from the customer, so that we can confirm that fix, and have an additional touchpoint with the customer.

If they do not follow up, we reach back out 3-5 days later with the “Close Ticket due to inactivity” canned response from Help Scout, and if no response then, close without a third reply.

Help Scout considers a ticket "resolved" only when the following things are true: 1. The customer has responded. 2. The support tech has marked the ticket as closed.

This is a crucial piece in understanding not only how we push toward a resolution, but also why we leave tickets as pending until they are confirmed to be resolved by the customer. We agree with Help Scout that the best way to confirm that an issue is resolved is by the customer responding to confirm. It also creates another touch point with the customer, which we value.

Some customers, no matter how often we ask, will still not reply to a ticket that has been resolved. For that reason, we close tickets after reaching out for resolution and checking Help Scout to confirm that the customer viewed the response.

In our reporting, we report on the close rate \(trusting that support techs only close issues that are resolved to the best of our knowledge\), and also on the resolve rate, which is the official Help Scout metric.
