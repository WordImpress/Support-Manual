# Getting to Resolution

Beyond the first response, every interaction with a customer in support has a singular goal: we get to resolution.

We solve our customer’s problems, in 3 replies or fewer. A resolved ticket is one that has at least one reply from the customer after the initial contact, and has been marked closed by us. We don’t mark a ticket as closed until it is confirmed resolved, or the customer has not replied after a few days and after we have followed up asking for confirmation.

## Help Scout Protocols
The first response is always marked as Pending, waiting for the customer to confirm the fix. We encourage a response from the customer, so that we can confirm that fix, and have an additional touch-point with the customer.

If they do not follow up, we reach back out 3-5 days later with the “Close Ticket due to inactivity” canned response from Help Scout, and if no response then, close without a third reply.

Help Scout considers a ticket "resolved" only when the following things are true: 1. The customer has responded. 2. The support tech has marked the ticket as closed.

This is a crucial piece in understanding not only how we push toward a resolution, but also why we leave tickets as pending until they are confirmed to be resolved by the customer. We agree with Help Scout that the best way to confirm that an issue is resolved is by the customer responding to confirm. It also creates another touch point with the customer, which we value.

Some customers, no matter how often we ask, will still not reply to a ticket that has been resolved. For that reason, we close tickets after reaching out for resolution and checking Help Scout to confirm that the customer viewed the response.

In our reporting, we report on the close rate \(trusting that support techs only close issues that are resolved to the best of our knowledge\), and also on the resolve rate, which is the official Help Scout metric.

## Problem Solvers, not Guessers
A common refrain in WordPress support is "have you tried deactivating all plugins?" to resolve an issue. We don't do put that work on the user of our plugins. Instead, we solve problems. 

Many times, while the advice to deactivate all plugins is the fastest way to diagnose an issue, asking the user to do it is asking them to disrupt the experience of site visitors, and to technically troubleshoot an issue that we are far better equipped to troubleshoot. 

Further, if we send them a reply to "deactivate all plugins" with no additional context, it's usually an indication that we are merely guessing at a solution, when we should instead reply with concrete steps to move closer to a resolution.

Any reply to the customer to "deactivate \_\_\_\_\_ plugin" (or any similar diagnostic step) should be because we, the experts, know that this will resolve the issue. Frame it as temporary, and a diagnostic tool to confirm our educated guess. Also, reassure the user that we will work to find a workaround for the conflicting plugin or theme. We solve problems.

To clarify using a simile, imagine a scenario where you visit a surgeon, complaining of pain. "Deactivate all Plugins" would be the equivalent of the surgeon asking you to take 15 pills and let her know which one works. 

We, like that surgeon, must give an educated, specific, and clear diagnosis. If that means asking more clarifying questions until the true cause of the problem shows up, that's far better than guessing and asking the user to confirm. We don't guess, we gather enough information to solve problems
