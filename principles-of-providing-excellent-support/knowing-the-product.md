# Knowing the Product

The single most important aspect of excellent support is knowledge of the product. As technical support technicians, nothing can replace deep knowledge of the product functionality, features, and areas of known weakness.

During the first 6 weeks of working in tech support, perhaps the most valuable time is spent in purposeful exploration of the product, as well as reviewing tickets already answered by other technicians.

It’s not expected or realistic for support technicians to be experts in every area of every product. Instead, it’s expected that technicians be constantly learning, and honest about where they are in product knowledge and experience.

To that end, it is encouraged that support technicians ask questions in the \#support channel on Slack when they run into areas they are unfamiliar with. This helps everyone grow in product knowledge.

There are three areas of product knowledge which are important to maintain:

1. General WordPress Knowledge
2. GiveWP Core Knowledge
3. GiveWP Add-on Knowledge

## General WordPress Knowledge

WordPress knowledge such as hooks \(actions and filters\), child theming, and how to extend WordPress without hacking core is indispensable in resolving customer issues.

Perhaps the best way to understand WordPress Core is to read the code itself, as well as the developer resources such as the theme and plugin developer's handbooks.

## GiveWP Core Knowledge

Knowledge of GiveWP Core is critical to resolving customer issues. Not only knowing what the plugin can do but also what it can't do without extension is important.

Among other skills:

* A support technician should be able to quickly locate the conditions which produce a specific error message, by looking at the plugin's code.
* A support technician should be able to explain, using the code as a reference, whether a filter or action exists for extending the plugin in a certain way.
* A support technician should be able to generally explain the order that code is executed in a typical donation.
* Given time, a support technician should be able to write simple snippets to utilize filters in GiveWP core.

## GiveWP Add-on Knowledge

GiveWP add-ons are constantly being added and updated. Support Technicians must stay ahead of that development by constantly monitoring new features, new functionality, and new issues and incompatibilities.

By virtue of our role and the time spent in tickets, much of the add-on functionality will be learned out of necessity, but it is critical that support technicians use both tickets and new development to spur their knowledge of add-ons.

Support technicians should regularly peruse GitHub as well as the feedback site for the latest feedback, issues, discussion, as well as the developer team summaries to see new development.

## Setting Actionable Product Knowledge Goals

Support technicians should set specific goals in terms of learning these concepts. An example of a specific goal for each area above would be:

* WordPress Core: `implement a child theme where additional style is enqueued alongside the parent theme style, this month.`
* GiveWP Core: `write a custom callback function to add text to the [give-receipt] output, and call it on the correct hook, this week.`
* GiveWP Add-ons: `identify within 5 minutes, given a site where I don't have backend access, which gateway is in use, today.`

Goals should be measurable and have an end date. Both [decompress time](../daily-routine/decompress-time.md) as well as [mental energy kickoff time](../daily-routine/mental-energy-kickoff.md) should be devoted to learning these concepts.
